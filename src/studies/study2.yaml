    definition: |
      Just as people have personality traits, brands and product categories
      can also be seen as having distinct personality traits. For example,
      a luxury fashion brand might seem "sophisticated" and "elegant,"
      while a toy company might seem "playful" and "fun."
    question: "Based on the description above, which of the following best describes brand personality?"
    options:
      - text: "A brand's financial performance and market share"
        correct: false
      - text: "The personality traits that consumers associate with a brand or product category"
        correct: true
      - text: "The personal opinions of a brand's CEO"
        correct: false
      - text: "The number of employees at a company"
        correct: false
