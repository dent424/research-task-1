    definition: |
      Brands and product categories can have personality traits, just like
      people. For example, a luxury fashion brand might seem "sophisticated"
      and "elegant," while a toy company might seem "playful" and "fun."
      In this study, you'll rate how characteristic certain personality
      traits are for different types of companies.
